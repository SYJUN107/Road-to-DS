- Why Monitor: Model drift (data drift, concept drift), performance degradation, data quality issues, bias detection.
- Key Metrics to Monitor: Input data distributions, prediction distributions, model performance (if ground truth available), latency, throughput, error rates.
- Alerting Strategies.

### Logging Observability

- Structured Logging.
- Distributed Tracing (conceptual).`
- Dashboards (e.g., Grafana).
