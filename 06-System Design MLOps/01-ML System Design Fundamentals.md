###  ML_System_Components_Architecture.md
- Overview of an End-to-End ML System: Data ingestion, feature store, training pipeline, model registry, model serving (online/offline), monitoring, feedback loops.

- Key Design Principles: Scalability, reliability, low latency, high throughput, extensibility, maintainability.

- Trade-offs: Latency vs. Throughput, Batch vs. Real-time.

###  Feature_Stores_Metadata_Management.md

- What is a Feature Store: Purpose (consistency, reusability, reduced featurization latency).

- Components: Online store (low latency for inference), Offline store (large-scale for training).

- Metadata Management: Tracking lineage, versions, owners.

###  Model_Deployment_Serving_Patterns.md

- Online Serving: REST APIs, gRPC, Flask/ FastAPI (conceptual).

- Offline Serving: Batch predictions.

- Model Versioning, A/B Testing in Production, Canary Deployments, Blue/Green Deployments.

- Cold Start Problem: Solutions (caching, pre-computation).

###  Interview_Examples_Solutions.md

- Clarifying questions.

- Functional/Non-functional requirements.

- Core components of the system (data sources, feature engineering, model training, serving, monitoring).

- Data flow diagram.

- High-level design, then drill down into specific components (e.g., serving layer, feature store).

- Scalability considerations, latency issues, trade-offs.

- Error handling, monitoring.

- Potential future improvements.

- *Examples*: Design a Recommendation System, Spam Detector, Search Ranking System, News Feed Ranking, Image Recognition System etc.
