- Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, Stemming, Lemmatization, Stop Words, Normalization.

- Text Representation: Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF.

- Word Embeddings: Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText (conceptual, skip-gram/CBOW brief).

- Core NLP Tasks: Text Classification, Sentiment Analysis, Named Entity Recognition (NER), Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging, Topic Modeling (LDA, Non-Negative Matrix Factorization NMF).

- Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) Models: NMT, Text Summarization (abstractive vs. extractive), Chatbots.

- Attention Mechanism (revisited for NLP).

- Transformers (revisited for NLP, focus on BERT/GPT architectures and fine-tuning).

- LLMs (revisited for applications - RAG, prompt engineering specifics for NLP tasks).
