- Image Preprocessing: Resizing, Augmentation techniques (flips, rotations, crops, color jitter).

- CNN Architectures (revisited for CV applications like ImageNet).

- Key CV Tasks: Image Classification, Object Detection (YOLO, Faster R-CNN - conceptual), Semantic/Instance Segmentation (U-Net, Mask R-CNN - conceptual).

- Transfer Learning: Pre-trained models, fine-tuning.

- Generative CV: GANs, VAEs, Diffusion Models (revisited for image generation).

- Vision Transformers (ViT) and their conceptual approach.
