- Types: Collaborative Filtering (User-based, Item-based), Content-Based, Hybrid.

- Collaborative Filtering Details:

- Memory-based (User-User, Item-Item similarity).

- Model-based: Matrix Factorization (Singular Value Decomposition SVD, Alternating Least Squares ALS for implicit feedback).

- Evaluation Metrics: Ranking metrics (Precision@K, Recall@K, NDCG), Diversity, Novelty, Coverage.

- Challenges: Cold Start Problem (new users/items), Scalability, Sparsity.

- Deep Learning for RecSys: Wide & Deep Learning, Recurrent/Graph Neural Networks for sequential/graph data.

- Candidate Generation vs. Ranking.
