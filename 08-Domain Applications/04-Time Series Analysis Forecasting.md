- Components: Trend, Seasonality, Cyclical, Noise.

- Stationarity: Tests (ADF, KPSS), Transformations (differencing).

- Autocorrelation (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation (PACF) plots.

- Traditional Models: ARIMA, SARIMA (P,D,Q,p,d,q,m components and how to choose), Exponential Smoothing (ETS - conceptual).

- Advanced Models: Prophet (components, advantages for business time series).

- Deep Learning for Time Series: RNNs, LSTMs, Transformers.

- Evaluation Metrics: MAE, RMSE, MAPE, SMAPE.

- Cross-validation for Time Series (walk-forward).
