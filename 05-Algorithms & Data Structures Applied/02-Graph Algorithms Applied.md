- Review: BFS/DFS (applications like shortest path on unweighted graphs, connectivity).

- Dijkstra's Algorithm: Shortest path on weighted graphs (non-negative weights).

- Bellman-Ford/Floyd-Warshall (briefly, for negative weights/all-pairs).

- Minimum Spanning Trees: Prim's, Kruskal's (conceptual).

- Centrality Measures: Degree, Betweenness, Closeness, Eigenvector Centrality, PageRank (conceptual, use cases in social networks, fraud).

- Community Detection: Louvain, Girvan-Newman (conceptual).

- Applications: Social networks, fraud detection, logistics, recommendation systems, knowledge graphs.
