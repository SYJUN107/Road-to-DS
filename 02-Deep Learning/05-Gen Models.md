### GANs
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): Generator-Discriminator architecture, adversarial training process.

- Challenges: Mode collapse, training instability.

- Variants: DCGAN, WGAN, Conditional GANs.

### VAEs
 - Variational Autoencoders (VAEs): Encoder-Decoder, latent space, reparameterization trick, ELBO (conceptual).
 - Comparison to GANs (mode collapse, sample diversity, stability).
### Diffusion Models
 - Conceptual understanding of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM).
 - Forward (noising) and Reverse (denoising) process.
 - Why they generate high-quality images.
 - Stable Diffusion / DALL-E (conceptual overview).
