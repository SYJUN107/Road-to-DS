### CNN_Architectures.md
- Convolutional Layer: Kernels, stride, padding.
- Pooling Layers: Max pooling, average pooling.
- Common Architectures: LeNet, AlexNet, VGG, ResNet (residual connections), Inception (multi-scale processing), MobileNet/EfficientNet (efficiency considerations), U-Net (down/up sampling for segmentation).
- Transfer Learning: Fine-tuning strategies, feature extraction.

- Object Detection: R-CNN family (Fast/Faster R-CNN), YOLO (concept, advantages), SSD.
- Semantic Segmentation: Pixel-level classification.
- Instance Segmentation: Mask R-CNN.
- Image Generation: (brief intro, deep dive in Generative Models).
