- K-Means: Algorithm steps, limitations (initialization, spherical clusters), elbow method, silhouette score.
- Hierarchical Clustering: Agglomerative vs. Divisive, dendrograms, linkage methods.
- DBSCAN: Density-based, core/border/noise points, advantages over K-Means.
- Evaluation Metrics: Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index (conceptual), practical considerations (interpretability).
