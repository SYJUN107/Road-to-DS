- Fairness Definitions/Metrics: Demographic Parity, Equalized Odds, Predictive Parity, Sufficiency, Disparate Impact. When each is relevant.
- Mitigation Strategies: Pre-processing (re-sampling, re-weighting), In-processing (adversarial debiasing, adding regularization terms), Post-processing (threshold adjustment).
- Trade-offs between fairness and accuracy.
