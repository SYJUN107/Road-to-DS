- Why Feature Selection: Reduce overfitting, improve interpretability, speed up training.
- Methods: Filter (correlation, chi-squared, ANOVA, info gain), Wrapper (forward/backward selection, RFE), Embedded (Lasso, tree-based importance).
- Dimensionality Reduction: PCA (math, conceptual interpretation, limitations), t-SNE, UMAP (conceptual, use cases).
