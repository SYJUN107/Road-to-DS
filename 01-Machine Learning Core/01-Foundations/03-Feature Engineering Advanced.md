- Common Techniques: One-hot encoding, label encoding, target encoding, frequency encoding, numerical scaling (standardization, normalization).
- Feature Interaction: Polynomial features, interaction terms.
- Time-based Features: Lag features, rolling averages, cyclical features, Fourier transforms for periodicity.
- Domain-Specific Feature Creation (brief examples for NLP, CV, RecSys).
- Embedding Techniques (brief intro, deep dive in DL section).
- Feature Scaling considerations for different models.
