- Confusion Matrix: True/False Positives/Negatives.
- Metric Definitions: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Specificity. When each is appropriate (imbalanced classes).
- ROC Curve & AUC: Interpretation, why ROC is useful for imbalanced data, what AUC represents.
- PR Curve & AUC: When to use instead of ROC (highly imbalanced data).
- LogLoss/Cross-Entropy: What it measures, interpretation.
- Calibration (predictive probability vs. true frequency).
