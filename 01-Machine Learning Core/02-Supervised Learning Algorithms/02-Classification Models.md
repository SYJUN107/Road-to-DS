- Logistic Regression: Sigmoid, decision boundary, cross-entropy loss, interpretation of odds ratios.
- Support Vector Machines (SVM): Max margin, kernel trick (linear, RBF), C parameter, hinge loss.
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Pros/Cons, distance metrics, curse of dimensionality effect.
- Naive Bayes: Why "Naive", Bayes' Theorem application, types (Gaussian, Multinomial, Bernoulli), assumptions.
