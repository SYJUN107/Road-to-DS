- Decision Trees: ID3/C4.5/CART, splitting criteria (Gini, Entropy), pruning techniques, pros/cons.
- Bagging: Random Forest (how it works, out-of-bag error, feature importance).
- Boosting: AdaBoost (conceptual), Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM - how it learns sequentially).
- XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost: Key differentiating features (parallelization, handling categorical features, leaf-wise vs. depth-wise), common hyperparameters, when to use which.
- Stacking & Blending (conceptual).
